## Module 9 Challenge


When looking at data from the months of December and June on a graph, there doesn't appear to be many differences. However, looking at statistical data, you can better see the similarities and differences. 

    1. The quarterile percentages, mean, min, max, and std are extremely similar. 
    2. The major difference is the number of instances that it rained. 
        - The month of June had 1,162 more instances of rain than the month of December. 
        - Although there is not a major temperature difference between the two months, June is a much rainier month. 
        
        
Some suggestions for further analysis would be to see how long each instance of rain lasted. All day rain could decrease sales, whereas small pockets of rain for 20-30 min may not have much of an affect. Along the same line, it would be helpful to know what time of day the rain occured. Lastly, analyzing statistical data for each month, grouped by year, would better this analysis. That way, you would be able to determine if there were years that June saw unprecendented rainfall that would skew the overall data we are looking at now.
